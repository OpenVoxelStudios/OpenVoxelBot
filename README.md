# OpenVoxelBot
The bot on our Discord server! Yes it's Open Sourced!

# How to run?
First, you need to edit the config a bit. So for that rename the `config_template.js` file into `config.js` and change it with what you want. For the token, create a bot and get it from discord developpers platform (I won't get into details here but go there https://discord.com/developers/applications).

And then your good to go!

`npm i`
and then
`npm start`

it's simple as that xD

# Can I use that code for my server?
Sure! If you can credit us it's better, but do what ever you want with that code (just follow the license lol)
